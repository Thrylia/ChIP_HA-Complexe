# ChIP_HA-Complexe

On this repository you will find a file called ‘Steps_commented.sh’ which contains all the commands used to analyse the ChIP-Seq data from Letkova et al (in prep).
The automated pipeline for the latter is currently being drafted and will be posted in the course of the year.

The bioinformatics analyses were performed on the Core Cluster of the Institut Français de Bioinformatique (IFB) (ANR-11-INBS-0013).
Some of them required a lot of resources. 

All the analyses were performed by me. 
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
